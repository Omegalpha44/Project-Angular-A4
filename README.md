Scolar project about creating a website with Angular 4

> To start the project, just go into the node_js_project file, and type the following command in the terminal : `npm start`
DO NOT use `ng serve` command, since it will not launch the backend server at the same time. 

> Backend server is launched on port 3000, and frontend server is launched on port 4200.

> Backend server is changeable, but is hosted on postgresSQL. The database is called "node_project", the user is "postgres" and the password is "root". A population file is available in the folder "postgresSQL population commands"
