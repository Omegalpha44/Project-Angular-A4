# Project-Angular-A4

Scolar project about creating a website with Angular

> To start the project, just go into the node_js_project file, and type the following command in the terminal : `npm start`
DO NOT use `ng serve` command, since it will not launch the backend server at the same time. 

> Backend server is launched on port 3000, and frontend server is launched on port 4200.

> Backend server is changeable, but is hosted on postgresSQL. The database is called "node_project", the user is "postgres" and the password is "root". A population file is available in the folder "postgresSQL population commands"

> addition and deletion of element from the postgresSQL is only implemented in the backend, meaning that with POSTMAN, you can use POST and DEL to add or delete an entry into the database. But, because of difficulty implementing it in the frontend, note that it is not currently possible to do so in it.
